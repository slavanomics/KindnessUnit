  "objectives": ["Kill the traitors Sigismund and Jerry"],
  "description": "Sigismund of the Pharmaceutical Department has been embezzling company funds and using them to gamble with highly speculative biological currencies. This would already be bad enough to warrant his immediate liquidation but he has also become increasingly deranged, flying into fits of rage and vomiting blood all over the office. While you're there you should also dispose of his accomplice, Jerry. He's scheduled to be hosting a meeting in the conference room with other executives."
