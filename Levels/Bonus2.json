  "description": "Ok this is kind of a weird one, I've actually got two jobs for you rather than just one. First and most importantly, some execs of our biggest competing firms have gathered at the opulent Gstaad Ski Resort to make some kind of business deal. Since they've decided to lock us out of this it can't be anything good, so we've come up with a plan of our own to liquidate these execs before they can cause any harm.\nWe also received a gig from the children of the owner of the hotel, Daniel Mullins. They say he has been planning an early retirement and are afraid he's going to waste all his money on complete frivolity, and are going to be left without any inheritance. Retire Daniel and give these kids some peace of mind. Think of it as humanitarian aid."
