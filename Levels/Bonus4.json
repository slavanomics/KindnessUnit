  "description": "The former public housing arcology in Helsinki has recently enjoyed bit of a housing market boom as a result of a biological weapons 'accident' wiping out 99% of the population. The new residents enjoy the rough, authentic vibe of the city and spend their nights partying in the former industrial district. The survivors of the depopulation incident and the relatives of the dead have successfully hosted a crowdfunding campaign to get rid of the key people behind their misery. It's rare for us to do this kind of thing for people of working class background but money, like love, is blind and based on transactions."
