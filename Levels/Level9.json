  "description": "The Corporate Arch Demoness Elsa Holmes recently spent an evening at the esteemed Fatberg Casino and somehow managed to lose the entirety of her vacation bonus. She's been seething mad ever since then and wants revenge. If this was anyone else we'd just laugh it off but since it's her we'll have to do something about it, that is go and murder the owner of the casino in his office. You should try some of the slotmachines while you're there, they're absolutely breathtaking."
