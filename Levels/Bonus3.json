  "description": "The CEO of our subsidiary Godhead Heavy Industries, Michael Brain, was last heard of when he left for some sort of silent retreat in Transnistria. Our sources say he had been suffering from severe burnout and had been talking about leaving the company. We don't know his exact location but you should start where his tracking signal went dead. Track him down and kill him, we have no use for someone so flakey. Shame as he used to be a great leader during his earlier days. I used to be a big fan, even had his poster on my wall."
