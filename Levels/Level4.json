  "name": "Androgen Assault",
  "objectives": ["Annihilate the chief of police and the leader of the narcotics unit"],
  "description": "Mark, the chief of the Cult of Order PD has long been useful in enforcing our will on the general populace but has recently started to get sloppy and uncontrollable. His messages, when he actually manages to respond, are completely incoherent and increasingly violent. We believe this rapid change in character has been caused by the experimental steroids supplied to him by the leader of narcotics unit, Magnus. Kill both of them and the Cult of Order can begin its healing process."
